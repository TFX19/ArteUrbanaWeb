# 🎨 Urban Art Web

Project developed to promote **urban art in Covilhã**, allowing users to search for artists and murals, as well as view their works on an **interactive map**. The platform also includes a **BackOffice** to facilitate the management of artists and murals, enabling the addition, editing, and removal of content in an intuitive way.

The platform aims to make urban art more visible and accessible to the public. Through the website, users can search for artists and murals, which are displayed in **cards** containing detailed information. Each artist and mural has a **dedicated page**, and in the case of murals, there is a link that redirects to the **3D view on Google Maps**.

In the **Explore** section, an **interactive map** using the **Google Maps API** displays **pinpoints of all murals**, allowing users to easily navigate through the artworks spread across the city.
